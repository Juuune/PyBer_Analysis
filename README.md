# PyBer Analysis Report

## Background and Results

### Purpose

- PyBer is a virtual python-based ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion and this analysis project is to 
perform an explanatory analysis on all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 with compelling visualizations. 
- The aims of this analysis is to get a snapshot of ride-sharing performance for different city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural), 
and to get idea about how to improve access of ride-sharing services and determine affordability for undeserved neighborhood

### Technical Analysis

#### 1) Summary of Ride Sharing Performance by each City Type 
![SummaryDF](https://github.com/Juuune/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/SummaryDF.PNG)

- The total rides of Urban area has almost 3 times more rides than Suburban and 10 times more rides than Rural area and 
- the total total fare of Urban city type is bigger than combined total fare of Suburban and Rural city type. 
- But the average fare per ride and aerage fare per driver is significantly higher in Rural city.
 
#### 2) Total Fare by each City Type
![Total_Fare_by_CityType](https://github.com/Juuune/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Total_Fare_by_CityType.png)

- The Urban city type and Suburban city type shows seasonal tendency in total fare data. 
- At the brginning of the January, it has lower total fares and gradually increse until March. At March total fares has a little spike and shows declining trend after. 

### Summary
- From the revenue generating point of view Urban City type has most ddstrategic importance and for the driver's policy it has more impact cause of number of total drivers. 
- Since the avg.fare per ride and the avg.fare per driver is higher in Rural area it seemed new drivers in Rural city type has more potential growth than other city type.


## Challenges Encountered and Overcome

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### 1) Programming
 - to drop index 
 - to get weekly resample 
 - get dataframe pivot table 
 
#### 2) Data analysis
 - to get the total drivers count 

#### 3) Graphing, etc
 - set date time x ticks and chage the interval of x ticks
